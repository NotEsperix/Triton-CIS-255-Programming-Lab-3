# CIS255 Lab 3 & 4: Laptop Inventory with Linked Lists

## Project Overview
This project is an extension of the Laptop Inventory System developed in Lab 2. It introduces the use of **linked lists** to manage a collection of laptops, allowing for more dynamic handling of data. Users can interact with the system to add, delete, modify, and display laptop records, with changes saved to a file for persistence.

## Features
- **Linked List Integration**: Manage a dynamic collection of laptop objects.
- **Add, Modify, Delete Products**: Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on laptop records.
- **CSV File Management**: Read and write laptop data to a CSV file, allowing updates to be saved across sessions.
- **Interactive Menu**: Navigate through the program using an interactive menu for administrative and consumer operations.

## Class Definitions
The project uses the following classes:
- **Laptop**: Represents individual laptop objects with attributes like brand, model, price, RAM, and storage.
